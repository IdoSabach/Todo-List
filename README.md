# Todo-List

The to-do list project was particularly challenging and fun, I experimented a little more with webpack and began to understand its capabilities. In addition, I learned about localstorage, how to export and save data in it and import back, all this with the help of JSON. In addition, I played a little with date's NPM libraries, I began to read a little about react and understood its importance And how he can help and facilitate us in projects of this kind.
Voila to the next project!
